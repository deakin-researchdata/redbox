self-submission.welcome.paragraph1=Welcome to Deakin University's data collection submission tool. <p> This tool will assist you in the process of creating a descriptive record for data collections produced as part of research you have conducted at Deakin University. <p> The self-submission interface will take you through the process of entering relevant information about your research data collections to enable the descriptive records to be discovered by other researchers. Based on the information you provide, your research data description will be submitted to <a href="http://dro.deakin.edu.au/">Deakin Research Online</a> (DRO) and <a href="http://researchdata.ands.org.au/">Research Data Australia</a> (RDA) and will be discoverable through these services and the services that harvest and index them worldwide. <p> By sharing a description of your research data collection with the broader research community, research data can be more easily discovered by others. This can translate into benefits for Deakin's researchers, including increases in the following areas of research collaborations, research profiles and citations for data that is used in other research projects.  Helping others to discover your work will result in exposure to further research opportunities. <p> Depending on your discipline or project, your research may engage with data such as: physical samples, photographs, written or audio-visual recordings, artwork, questionnaires or other instruments, fieldwork notes, and other items which are the sources of data or themselves constitute data in a research project. <p> The information you provide to the self-submission interface will be shared with the broader research community.  It is important to note that it is only the description of your data collection that is being shared at this point. Your data is not being exposed to the public and you will still have control over how your data can be accessed and who will have this access. <p> Where possible, we have pre-filled this form with information from Deakin's Research Management Systems and also from the <a href="/footprints/dashboard/home">Data Management Planning Tool</a> if you have previously created a Data Management Plan using this tool.  Please note that you do not need to have completed a Data Management Plan to use the self-submission interface. <p> If you have any queries regarding your research project details or project data that have been been pre-filled, please contact <a href="http://www.deakin.edu.au/research">Deakin Research</a>. <p> If you require any assistance completing your research data collection description, please <a href="https://dro.deakin.edu.au/contact">contact DRO staff</a> or visit the <a href="http://www.deakin.edu.au/research/eresearch/manage-data/">Manage Research Data</a> website.

#Title
self-submission.field.label.dc-title=Title (*)
self-submission.field.help.dc-title=Enter a title that identifies your research dataset or collection, that is unique to the data.  Do not use the publication or project title as the data title. Include discipline specific keywords in your title. 

#Description
self-submission.field.label.dc-description=Description (*)
self-submission.field.help.dc-description=Enter a description of your dataset or collection summarising the fundamental characteristics.  This will be one of the main attributes used by other researchers to identify your collection, so it is important to make the description of your data as rich and concise as possible using discipline specific keywords and terminology and avoiding acccronyms. For example, 'this dataset lists rainfall and stream hydrograph analysis at Samford Valley in an Adobe PDF file'  and 'the data illustrates the mean monthly rainfall at Samford and highlights the dominance of summer rainfall'. <p> Ideally, a good data collection description will open up the possibility of an informed judgement about the potential usefulness of a data collection. It might address the following points: <ul> <li>What is the research problem/question that the collection of this data seeks to solve?</li> <li>Why is this problem/question important or significant?</li> <li>How are you collecting the data, are instruments involved? and how are they calibrated? (i.e. methodology)</li> <li>What kinds of transformations/normalisations are needed to transform the raw data into something useful?</li> <li>What conclusions are being drawn from the data?</li> </ul>
