#Title
self-submission.field.label.dc-title=Title (*)
self-submission.field.help.dc-title=Please provide a title that meaningfully identifies your research dataset/collection, registry/repository, catalogue or index. For datasets and collections, please ensure that the title is unique to the data (do not use the publication or project title as the data title) and try to include discipline specific keywords in your title. In sharing your research data descriptions, it is important to ensure that a non-technical audience can understand your project title.<br/>If you have any questions regarding  your data collection description title, please contact Deakin Library at http://www.deakin.edu.au/library/research/manage-and-share-data.php

#Description
self-submission.field.label.dc-description=Description (*)
self-submission.field.help.dc-description=Please enter a description of your dataset or collection. Your description will be one of the main attributes used by other researchers to identify your research data collection, so try to make the description of your data as rich as possible, but also try to keep it concise and aim it at a non-technical audience. If possible, use discipline specific keywords and terminology but try to avoid jargon or obscure acronyms. The details of your description should summarise the fundamental characteristics of your data. For example, 'this dataset lists rainfall and stream hydrograph analysis at Samford Valley in an Adobe PDF file'. Summarise what the data illustrates. For example 'the data illustrates the mean monthly rainfall at Samford and highlights the dominance of summer rainfall'. <br/>If you have any questions regarding the description of your data collection, please contact Deakin Library at http://www.deakin.edu.au/library/research/manage-and-share-data.php
